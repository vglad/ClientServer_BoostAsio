# ClientServer_BoostAsio
Distributed application using Boost::Asio in C++17

Work in progress...

Initial goal is to create cross-platform asynchronous Client and Server modules using Boost::Asio.
Both communicate over TCP or UDP, IPv4 or IPv6 protocols.

Testing done using Catch2 and Trompeloeil in OpenSuse Tumbleweed Linux (GCC 9.2).
